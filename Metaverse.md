**Metaverse and Web3.0**

```

Metaverse and NFTs for marketing:
with Web1.0 we are able to connect to internet with unlimited speed for getting information
with Web2.0 connected people through the internet which gave us social media platforms like facebook, 
Twitter, linkedin and Instagram. It also gave us the sharing economy and eCommerce.
Web3.0 is about connecting people, places and things. sometimes these can be fully virtual in a fully virtual environment while other times they can be in physical world through augmented reality.

Evolution of web is an important shift in the future of how we communicate, work, shop and socialize, and it'll impact us today and into future

Metaverse101 for Marketers:
Metaverse is the successor of today's mobile internet
Web1.0 connected information and gave us the internet
Web2.0 connected people and that gave us social media
Web3.0 connects people, places and things or people, spaces and assets.

Metaverse will be enabled by different technologies like blockchain, artificial intelligence and augmented reality, virtual reality, 5G, edge computing and beyond.

In metaverse content is persistent and is compromised of vast amounts of information and activity.
that stays anchored where you play or go and stays in place even if you aren't there.


It is persistent dynamic and sharable and 3D- machine readable

ex: Roblox is a gaming platform that brings people together through play
the company boasts an impressive 43.2 million daily active users worldwide.
Decentraland is a decentralized world that's owned by its users who get to vote on how the world operates
brands like samsung are buying up digital real estate for their virtual stores.
The excitement surrounding cyberspaces is creating a metaverse land rush, with some parcels selling for even millions of dollars.

before opening crypto wallet it is important to think about how your brand or company wants to engage in these new spaces.

Does owning a digital flagship store make sense?
how would you attract people to visit it?
what type of transactions can happen there?
Before we end this lesson I did want to remaind you that the metaverse is very nascent
and even if you see the word in many headlines, you are still early.
you are here to level up your knowledge.


Metaverse is also being made possible with Cloud computing, edge computing, IoT, 5G.
Cloud computing is the on demand availability of computer system resources especially data storage and computing power.

Edge computing is the availability to distribute processing resources across multiple devices

The IoT is the connection of everyday objects to the internet.
5G is enabling faster data transfers.

Together these make it possible to render rich fluid experiences that wouldn't be possible.
They're also helping power another mechanism that is central to currency and exchange.

Blockchain is one of the building blocks of the metaverse as it is the technology that enable us to have digital ownership of digital assets.


Block chain in essence is a decentralized distributed and often times public ditial ledger consisting of records called blocks
that are used to record transactions.

All these technologies and many more enable the convergence of our physical and digital worlds which brings us closer to metaverse, this greater vision of being built today and in future.
