**GoLang**

Go language is a programming language initially developed at Google in the year 2007.  
It provides garbage collection, type safety, dynamic-typing capability, many advanced built-in types such as variable length arrays and key-value maps. general-purpose language designed with systems programming in mind. strongly and statically typed, provides inbuilt support for garbage collection, and supports concurrent programming. Programs are constructed using packages, for efficient management of dependencies. Go programming implementations use a traditional compile and link model to generate executable binaries. 
```
The most important features of Go programming are listed below −

Support for environment adopting patterns similar to dynamic languages. For example, type inference (x := 0 is valid declaration of a variable x of type int)
Compilation time is fast.
Inbuilt concurrency support: lightweight processes (via go routines), channels, select statement.
Go programs are simple, concise, and safe.
Support for Interfaces and Type embedding.
Production of statically linked native binaries without external dependencies.

Features Excluded Intentionally
To keep the language simple and concise, the following features commonly available in other similar languages are omitted in Go −
Support for type inheritance
Support for method or operator overloading
Support for circular dependencies among packages
Support for pointer arithmetic
Support for assertions
Support for generic programming
