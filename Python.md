**Python:**
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language.
```
Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.

Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.
It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.
It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.
It supports automatic garbage collection.
It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.

Setting up PATH:
Add to environment variable python home folder path


Python Environment Variables
Here are important environment variables, which can be recognized by Python −

PYTHONPATH
It has a role similar to PATH. This variable tells the Python interpreter where to locate the module files imported into a program. It should include the Python source library directory and the directories containing Python source code. PYTHONPATH is sometimes preset by the Python installer.

PYTHONSTARTUP
It contains the path of an initialization file containing Python source code. It is executed every time you start the interpreter. It is named as .pythonrc.py in Unix and it contains commands that load utilities or modify PYTHONPATH.

PYTHONCASEOK
It is used in Windows to instruct Python to find the first case-insensitive match in an import statement. Set this variable to any value to activate it.

PYTHONHOME
It is an alternative module search path. It is usually embedded in the PYTHONSTARTUP or PYTHONPATH directories to make switching module libraries easy.

There are three different ways to start Python −
Interactive Interpreter
You can start Python from Unix, DOS, or any other system that provides you a command-line interpreter or shell window.


list of all the available command line options 
-d
It provides debug output.

-O
It generates optimized bytecode (resulting in .pyo files).

-S
Do not run import site to look for Python paths on startup.

-v
verbose output (detailed trace on import statements).

-X
disable class-based built-in exceptions (just use strings); obsolete starting with version 1.6.

-c cmd
run Python script sent in as cmd string

file
run Python script from given file

Script from the Command-line
A Python script can be executed at command line by invoking the interpreter on your application

Integrated Development Environment
You can run Python from a Graphical User Interface (GUI) environment as well, if you have a GUI application on your system that supports Python.

Unix − IDLE is the very first Unix IDE for Python.

Windows − PythonWin is the first Windows interface for Python and is an IDE with a GUI.

Macintosh − The Macintosh version of Python along with the IDLE IDE is available from the main website, downloadable as either MacBinary or BinHex'd files.
