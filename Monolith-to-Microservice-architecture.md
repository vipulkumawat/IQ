**Monolith to Microservice architecture**
```
software-architecture-breaking-a-monolith-into-microservices:
have a monolith application?
solution= microservice?
how do I start?
is there a process?
challenges?

Gather Goals:
Move everything to cloud with assumption infra cost is reduced
Do a redesign - it doesnot really matter as they don't have the compition in the market
Release native Apps for android and IOS - customer are happy with existing website not really a requirement from customers
Use kubernetes - there is no business value attached to it.
Scale better and more effectively under load-  yes we can scale horizontally very useful during high load
Reduce build times - helps increase developer productivity and effect and ofcourse the business
Release more often - new features can be released very frequently without disturbing other features. possiblity of breaking other existing code is less.
Reduce the blast radius of errors - errors are centralized and other features are not effected because of issue in one service
Become polyglot to attract specialists - new joiners can quickly understand the features in microservice architecture rather than understanding whole monolith at once
