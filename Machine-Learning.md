K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
More Data> Better Model> Higher accuracy

Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Reinforced Learning


Supervised Learning:
Supervised learning uses labeled data for training model
here machine know the feature of the object and also label associated with those features.
learn from feature and labels then predict the new inputs


Unsupervised learning:
cricketer, scores, wickets
clustering based on scores and wickets then identifying player performance
No labels involved here
Learning from unlabeled data is called unsupervised learning


Reinforcement learning:
reward based learning
works on the principle of feedback
Dog/cat identification problem
Learning from feedback


Input->algorithm model->output
applies algorithm model to given input which then gives an output according to algo applied
if output is correct we take output as final result
else we give feedback to training model and ask it to predict then it learns



Quiz:
1. facebook face recognition of your friend picture from the album of tagged photographs
Reinforced learning

2. Netflix movie recommendations
Unsupervised learning

3.Analysing back data for suspecious transactions for flagging Fraud transaction
Fraud detection
Supervised learning

How is ML possible in today's era?
Huge amount of data available online, every body makes transaction or surfing internet that generates huge amount of data every minute.
that data is key to analysis. memory handling capabilities of computers have increased which helps them to process huge amount of data at hand without any delay.
Computers have great computational power.

Applications of ML:
Healthcare
Sentiment analysis
Fraud Analysis
E-commerce
Search pricing of cabs used by Uber, 
Differential pricing in real time based on :
-Demand
-Number of Cars available
-Bad weather
-Rush hour

It also uses predictive modeling to predict where the demand will be high with a goal that drivers can take care of the demand and search pricing will be minimized

ML is subset of AI
Sense
Reason
Act
Adapt

Deeplearning is subbranch of ML

Neighbourhood based algo along with Navibase
ML uses algorithms to mimic human learning in machines
It is subset of AI

Reinforced learning for pet detection
build up a model based on examples which is called supervised learning


classification and regression are the types of unsupervised learning

Popular algo in Supervised learning:
Decision tree
Naive bayes
Linear Regression
SVM

Unsupervised learning:
Don't have a predetermined result in mind
the machine tries to make sense of things from huge amount of data
given many photos of animals machine starts segregating them by color, size, shape
such an approach is called unsupervised learning
Clustering and Association are types of unsupervised learning
Popular algos of Unsupervised learning:
K-means
Hierarchical
Apriori
Genetic Algorithm

Reinforcement learning:
Rewards and punishment
learn from feedback
Teaches machine where it made a mistake and where it is right
thus machine develops intelligence and makes better decisions in future because of reinforcement
ex: google's New AI designs AI better than Humans Could
Alibaba's AI
PCWorld: Five things AI does better than humans, from the mundane to the magnificent
Building wooden block towers
Lip reading
Transcribing
News Reporting
Disease diagnosis

ML works on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to automatically learn and improve from experience
Difference between AI, ML, Deep learning
AI: a technique which enables machines to mimic human behavior
IBM deep blue chess
Electronic Game Characters

ML: which uses statistical methods, enabling machines to learn from their past data
IBM watson
Google search algorithm
Email spam filter

Deep learning: Subset of ML, composing algorithms that allow a model to train itself and preform tasks
Alpha Go
Natural Speech Recognition
Deep learning is associated with tools like neural networks which is kind of blackbox as it learns it changes as a human it is hard for tracking.

Training Data
Train the ML algo
Processing
new input data->ML Algo->prediction->feedback/Result

Main categories of ML:
Supervised Learning

Known Data-> ML algo->processing-> trained model-> new Response with given unknown data

Algoirthms for Supervised learning:
Polynomial Regression
Random Forest

K-Means clustering
Apriori
Hierarchical Clustering
Principal Component Analysis

ML prerequisits:
computer science fundamentals and programming
Intermediate statistical knowledge- probabilities
Linear algebra and intermediate calculus - what is differential equation is etc, computer does all heavy lifting but need to know the terms when comeup. 
Data wrangling and cleaning: how to cleanup your data. need to get good data

Some applications of ML:
Instance segmentation for object detection
Number plate detection
Automatic transulation for machine transulation


Algorithms:
Linear regression
Logistic Regression
KMeans Clustering

Machine Learning is the science of making computers learn and act like humans by feeding data and information without being explicitly programmed!

Ordinary System
+ With AI
gives machine learning
It Learns, Predicts and Improves





what is ML?
Define Objective
Collect Data
Prepare Data
Select Algorithm
Train Model
Test Model
Predict
Deploy


Do you want to predict a Category? that's classification
for instance whether stock price will increase or decrease

Do you want to predict a quantity? That's regression
For instance, Predicting the age of a person based on the height, weight, health and other factors

Do you want to detect an anomaly? That's anomaly detection
For instance you want to detect money withdrawal anomalies

Do you want to discover structure in unexplored data? That's clustering
For instance finding groups of customers with similar behavior given a large database of customer data containing their demographics and past buying records


Types of ML:
Supervised
UnSupervised
Reinforcement

Supervised learning:
it is a method used to enable machines to classify/predict objects, problems or situations based on labeled data fed to the machine

Labeled data
