K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
More Data> Better Model> Higher accuracy

Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Reinforced Learning


Supervised Learning:
Supervised learning uses labeled data for training model
here machine know the feature of the object and also label associated with those features.
learn from feature and labels then predict the new inputs


Unsupervised learning:
cricketer, scores, wickets
clustering based on scores and wickets then identifying player performance
No labels involved here
Learning from unlabeled data is called unsupervised learning


Reinforcement learning:
reward based learning
works on the principle of feedback
Dog/cat identification problem
Learning from feedback


Input->algorithm model->output
applies algorithm model to given input which then gives an output according to algo applied
if output is correct we take output as final result
else we give feedback to training model and ask it to predict then it learns



Quiz:
1. facebook face recognition of your friend picture from the album of tagged photographs
Reinforced learning

2. Netflix movie recommendations
Unsupervised learning

3.Analysing back data for suspecious transactions for flagging Fraud transaction
Fraud detection
Supervised learning

How is ML possible in today's era?
Huge amount of data available online, every body makes transaction or surfing internet that generates huge amount of data every minute.
that data is key to analysis. memory handling capabilities of computers have increased which helps them to process huge amount of data at hand without any delay.
Computers have great computational power.
