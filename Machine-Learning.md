K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
More Data> Better Model> Higher accuracy

Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Reinforced Learning


Supervised Learning:
Supervised learning uses labeled data for training model
here machine know the feature of the object and also label associated with those features.
learn from feature and labels then predict the new inputs
