**Scala Programming:**
Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level language. Scala's static types help avoid bugs in complex applications, and its JVM and JavaScript runtimes let you build high-performance systems with easy access to huge ecosystems of libraries.

```
Scala is a modern multi-paradigm programming language designed to express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way.
smoothly integrates the features of object-oriented and functional languages. 
Scala  is a hybrid functional programming language.
Scala is compiled to run on the Java Virtual Machine. 
Scala is pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object. 
Types and behavior of objects are described by classes and traits which will be explained in subsequent chapters.
Classes are extended by subclassing and a flexible mixin-based composition mechanism as a clean replacement for multiple inheritance.

Scala is functional:
Scala is also a functional language in the sense that every function is a value and every value is an object so ultimately every function is an object.
Scala provides a lightweight syntax for defining anonymous functions, it supports higher-order functions, it allows functions to be nested, and supports currying. These concepts will be explained in subsequent chapters.
Scala is statically typed
Scala, unlike some of the other statically typed languages (C, Pascal, Rust, etc.), does not expect you to provide redundant type information. You don't have to specify a type in most cases, and you certainly don't have to repeat it.
Scala runs on the JVM
Scala is compiled into Java Byte Code which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that Scala and Java have a common runtime platform. You can easily move from Java to Scala.

The Scala compiler compiles your Scala code into Java Byte Code, which can then be executed by the 'scala' command. The 'scala' command is similar to the java command, in that it executes your compiled Scala code.

Scala can Execute Java Code:
