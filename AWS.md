cloud computing is processing on the internet or a private network where the exact processor location is unknown

use of aws can reduce hardware, operational and deployment cost
cloud  computing still uses servers, they are simply hidden from the view


benefits of cloud computing:
reduces hardware cost
operational cost of managing servers
deployment cost is reduced in figuring out the right type  of servers
scale out or scale in easy with cloud

Increased resiliency by removing unhealthy servers and spinning up new server
Performance is increased as it can scale out when required as traffic increases by auto scaling
Pay as you use
Capacity can be increased as required as aws storage feature gives as needed



cloud computing models:
Full cloud or all in cloud in model:
db/application/general storage  everything on cloud

hybrid deployment:
some resources are internal, others are in the cloud. high performing systems on cloud and low performing systems on cloud.
archive storage, backups etc
-processing
-database
-application logic


IaaS: Infrastructure as service
-Entire infrastructure in cloud
-Platfoorms and software run on others infrastructure
-yoou must manage it all

PaaS: platform as a service
you don't manage the infrastructure
applications are deplooyed on platform


SaaS - Software as a Service:
-someone else develps the software
-You use it from the cloud
