use of aws can reduce hardware, operational and deployment cost
cloud  computing still uses servers, they are simply hidden from the view


benefits of cloud computing:
reduces hardware cost
operational cost of managing servers
deployment cost is reduced in figuring out the right type  of servers
scale out or scale in easy with cloud

Increased resiliency by removing unhealthy servers and spinning up new server
Performance is increased as it can scale out when required as traffic increases by auto scaling
Pay as you use
Capacity can be increased as required as aws storage feature gives as needed
